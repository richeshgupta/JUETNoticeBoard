# Why?
	We are studying in a university so our teachers needed to distribute us study materials and inform us regarding classes. A Class Representative was made so that he can inform everyone about the class timmings. There was a lot of information lost in conveying the message. So, we tried to make a portal so that this problem could be overcome and the teacher could directly inform everyone. 
# How?
	On django 2.0,  after learning a little coding. I thought let's try if i can make something quickly.

# How Much time did it took?
	We are still working on the project. It is under development phase.

# Who are we?
	We are Pantomath. We want to create projects to solve daily life problems
