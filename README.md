## About Project
We, the Pantomath, have created this project to solve a real-life problem of our faculty members of conveying information to the students. If any teacher wanted to convey any message to any batch then they first had to tell it to the Class Representative (CR) and then the CR would further convey it to the batch students. In this process there is a lot of information gap that leads to wrong analysis of the information. So, with our little knowledge about Web Development we tried to create one stop for students and faculty members that would let teachers directly post about anything and the students could get the information directly from here. The post would include: 
	
**TITLE**	: Title of the Post (Required)

**CONTENT**	: All information about the post (Required)

**DATE**	: Date and time of the post 

**URL**		: To provide any link to website (Optional)

**DOCS**	: To provide any study material (Optional)
